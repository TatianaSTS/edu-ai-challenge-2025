DeepSeek
You are a software architecture expert. Iâ€™m designing a social platform with the following requirements:

Millions of users
Need to store user profiles, posts, and social connections (e.g., followers, friends)
High read performance is critical
80% of operations are reads, 20% are writes
The system must scale efficiently as the user base grows
Apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to:

Analyze each requirement step-by-step
Evaluate different types of databases (e.g., relational, NoSQL, graph, document, key-value)
Justify which type of database is most suitable for this project
Clearly explain how each requirement influenced your final decision
Your reasoning should be structured, logical, and transparent.
