Here’s the structured bug ticket based on the informal note:

**Title:** Logout Button Unresponsive in Safari Browser  

**Description:**  
The logout button does not respond when clicked in the Safari browser. No action is triggered, and the user remains logged in. This issue does not occur in other browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).  

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Open the application in Safari.  
2. Log in to a user account.  
3. Click the logout button.  
4. Observe that no action occurs—user remains logged in.  

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Clicking the logout button should terminate the session and redirect the user to the login page (or home screen, if applicable).  

**Actual Behavior:**  
- The logout button does nothing—no redirect, no session termination, no error message.  

**Environment (if known):**  
- Browser: Safari (Version [X.X] if known)  
- OS: macOS/iOS (Version [X.X] if known)  
- Device: (Desktop/Mobile, if applicable)  

**Severity/Impact:**  
- **Severity:** Medium (blocks core functionality but has a workaround, e.g., using another browser)  
- **Impact:** Affects user experience and security—users cannot log out in Safari.

### Additional Notes for the Dev Team:  
- Check for Safari-specific JS/CSS compatibility issues (e.g., event listeners not firing).  
- Verify session/cookie handling in Safari vs. other browsers.  
- Console logs or network tab errors may help diagnose the issue.  

Let me know if you'd like to add any details (e.g., specific Safari versions, repro rate) to improve debugging!
