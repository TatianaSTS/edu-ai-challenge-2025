I have a bug note “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.” 
Your task is to convert informal bug notes into clear, well-structured bug tickets. The output should follow this format:
Title
Description
Steps to Reproduce
Expected vs Actual Behavior
Environment (if known)
Severity or Impact

Please convert this note into a structured bug ticket.
